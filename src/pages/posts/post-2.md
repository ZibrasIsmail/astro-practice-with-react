# My Second Blog Post

Published on: 2023-07-08

After a successful first week learning Astro, I decided to try some more. I wrote and imported a small component from memory!

## What I've accomplished

1. **Component Creation**: I created a new component to display a greeting.

2. **Component Import**: I successfully imported and used the component in my home page.

3. **Styling**: I added some basic styling to my components for a better look.

## What's next

I will continue to explore more advanced Astro concepts and work on improving the design of my site.
