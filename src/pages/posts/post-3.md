# My Third Blog Post

Published on: 2023-07-15

It wasn't always smooth sailing, but I'm enjoying building with Astro. And, the [Discord community](https://astro.build/chat) is really friendly and helpful!

## What I've struggled with

1. **Integrations**: I had some trouble getting certain integrations to work correctly.

2. **Deployment**: Deploying my site took more effort than I expected.

3. **CSS Styling**: Getting my styles just right has been a challenge.

## What I've learned

Despite the challenges, I've learned a lot about Astro and web development in general. The community has been a great resource for overcoming obstacles.
